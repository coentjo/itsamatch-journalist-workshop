## What is a Vault?

A vault is a ***collection of notes*** (which are basically files on your hard disk) together with ***relations*** between them. Look at the `Graph View`  ( ![[button.graph.view.png]]  , find it on the upper left-side) to get an impression of the notes and how they are connected.

## Why would you use Obsidian? 

- Create structured notes. 
- Knowledge management. 
- A lot of information is ***in-between*** the documents: in how they are related! 


## Making and Linking Notes

As with most computer applications nowadays, when you hover the cursor above an icon or button, after a second or the name will pop-up, giving a hint of what will happen if you press it. 


- Graph View for overview.
- Move files, links will be updated!
- 'Export to pdf'.
