## What is a Vault?

A vault is a ***collection of notes*** (which are basically files on your hard disk) together with ***relations*** between them. Look at the `Graph View`  ( ![[button.graph.view.png]]  , find it on the upper left-side) to get an impression of the notes and how they are connected.

## Why would you use Obsidian? 

- Create structured notes. 
- Knowledge management. 
- A lot of information is ***in-between*** the documents: in how they are related! 


## Making and Linking Notes

As with most computer applications nowadays, when you hover the cursor above an icon or button, after a second or the name will pop-up, giving a hint of what will happen if you press it. 


- Graph View for overview.
- Move files, links will be updated!
- 'Export to pdf'.

## How to start Exploring? 


![[menu.upper.png]]
From left to right: 
- ***Files***: when selected you see these items: ![[menu.upper.second.line.png]], of which the leftmost two (New Note, New Folder) are the most used. I think these names speak for themselves. 
- *Search*.
- *Bookmarks*: store links to important pages. 

In the corner left below you find these buttons: 
![[menu.left.down.png]], which we will discuss in the next 3 chapters. 

### 1. *Open another Vault*

So, a ***Vault*** is basically a folder (directory) on your machine containing files (mainly markdown, `.md`-files, called `notes`) and (sub)folders. ***Any*** folder can be chosen to act as a *Vault*.

### 2. *Help


### 3. *Settings*

There are some settings worth to talk about already, now. 

Press the 'Settings'-button ( ![[button.settings.png]] ) or go to the 'Settings'-menu. Always good to have a glance at the existing options.
