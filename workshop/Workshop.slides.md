# Workshop Knowledge Graphs

--- 

This text is the companion to the Workshop that was given by Iman, Berry and Coen in Mindlabs, Tilburg, on 8 Februari 2024. We hope to have inspired people by telling and showing a little bit about Knowledge Graphs and how to use them to investigate some news subject, and in the process showing an example of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and how a tool like Obsidian can be used to dive into Knowledge. This page will help you install Obsidian, but following the download instructions you will also find the information about Knowledge Graphs we shared in the workshop.

## What is a Vault?

A vault is a ***collection of notes*** (which are basically files on your hard disk) together with ***relations*** between them. Look at the `Graph View`  ( ![[button.graph.view.png]]  , find the button on the upper left-side) to get an impression of the notes and how they are connected. Below you see an example, but please look at a live one.

## Why would you use Obsidian? 

- Create structured notes. 
- Knowledge management. 
- A lot of information is ***in-between*** the documents: in how they are related! 
- Using Obsidian to move files around, links will automatically be updated. This makes note taking very agile.

## How to start Exploring? 

Let's look at some menu items. As with most computer applications nowadays, when you hover the cursor above an icon or button, after a second or so the name will pop-up, giving a hint of what will happen if you press it. 

---

This way you could find for example the 'Export to pdf' functionality: it is in the '...'-menu (upper-right). 

---

![[menu.upper.png]]
From left to right: 
- ***Files***: when selected you see these items: ![[menu.upper.second.line.png]], of which the leftmost two (New Note, New Folder) are the most used. I think these names speak for themselves. 
- *Search*.
- *Bookmarks*: store links to important pages. 

---

In the corner left below you find these buttons: 
![[menu.left.down.png]], which we will discuss in the next 3 chapters. 

---
### 1. *Open another Vault*

So, a ***Vault*** is basically a folder (directory) on your machine containing files (mainly markdown, `.md`-files, called `notes`) and (sub)folders. ***Any*** folder can be chosen to act as a *Vault*.

The first options ('Create...' and 'Open...') are more or less self-explaining.

The 'Open vault from Obsidian Sync' is for paying customers: contents will be stored on the internet (~in the cloud) and several people can work together on 1 vault. We however did not need that yet.  

---

### 2. *Help

Some places to get help. One nice one is the 'Sandbox vault', which is a Practice-what-you-Preach-Vault: info about Obsidian *within* an Obsidian Vault. 

---

### 3. *Settings*

There are some settings worth to talk about already, now. 

Press the 'Settings'-button ( ![[button.settings.png]] ) or go to the 'Settings'-menu. Always good to have a glance at the existing options. Some that we think could be of importance for you: 

- **General/Language**. 
- **Editor/Spell check**.
- **Files and links/Detect all file extensions**: if you want to see **all** kinds of files: for example docx, xlsx, pptx and so on. 
- **Appearance/Base Color Scheme**: Do you prefer Light mode or Dark mode?
- **Core Plugins**: see next Chapter, or just experiment yourself. 

---

## Plug-ins

Divided in 2 categories: 

--- 
### 1. Core Plug-ins

- **Audio recorder**.
- **Daily notes**: to put the Date automatically in new notes names (Zettelkasten).
- **Slides**: to present. 

---

### 2. Community Plug-ins
**Community Plug-ins/Browse**: to see what's already been created. Some examples: 
- **Mind Map**.
- **RSS Reader**.
- **Charts**.
