# Motivation:
Build a lab for (investigative) journalists to explore AI.
AI:
- Reveal relations, patterns, and trends
- Manage information: semantically organizing information
- Images, text, graphs](ai:- Reveal relations, patterns, and trends- Manage information: semantically organizing information- Images, text, graphs)

Considerations:
- Have full control over the process, sensitive information are not preferably sent to the cloud
	- This rules out OpenAI
	- I will demo use of free open source SW that can be used on a laptop with limited resources
- Provide LLMs with factual background 
	- This motivates "retrieval assisted augmentation"

Why Networks?

Network analysis is a powerful tool that can help journalists uncover hidden stories and connections that shape our world. [By analyzing digital networks, journalists can understand how information flows online and who’s really behind user accounts and messaging networks](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/network-analysis-enters-the-journalism-toolbox/)[1](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/network-analysis-enters-the-journalism-toolbox/). [This can help journalists identify coordinated and hidden activity on various social networks and trace patterns and activity not visible through ordinary use of the platforms](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/network-analysis-enters-the-journalism-toolbox/)[1](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/network-analysis-enters-the-journalism-toolbox/).

[Narrating Networks (tandfonline.com)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21670811.2016.1186497)  identified five different ways it was being used by journalists:
1. To explore associations around individual actors (such as networks of personal power)
2. To detect ‘key players’ (those who [hold power less visibly](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627643-700-paper-trail-inside-the-stem-cell-wars/))
3. To map alliances and oppositions
4. To explore the evolution of associations over time (for example [how political parties became less cooperative](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123507)); and
5. To reveal hidden ties

Division of Democrat and Republican Party members over time.

Each member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949–2012 is drawn as a single node. Republican (R) representatives are in red and Democrat (D) representatives are in blue, party affiliation changes are not reflected. Edges are drawn between members who agree above the Congress’ _threshold value_ of votes. The _threshold value_ is the number of agreements where any pair exhibiting this number of agreements is equally likely to comprised of two members of the same party (e.g. D-D or R-R), or a cross-party pair (e.g. D-R). Each node is sized relative to its total number of connections; edges are thicker if the pair agrees on more votes. The starting year of each 2-year Congress is written above the network.

[Slovak MPs’ response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in light of conspiracy theories and the polarization of political discourse (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02276-8.pdf)

![[Pasted image 20240118164454.png]]

Here is a summary of the paper

- **Main idea**: The paper investigates how Slovak MPs communicated on Facebook about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, using Discourse Network Analysis to examine the content, structure, and change of the political discourse network.
- **Key findings**:
    - The invasion dramatically changed the political discourse in Slovakia, with the domestic coalition-opposition struggles losing prominence among the invasion-related topics
    - The structure of the political discourse network showed a strong coalition-opposition split, with coalition MPs having largely pro-Ukrainian sentiments and opposition MPs largely communicating pro-Russian propaganda and conspiracy theories
    - The change of the discourse network was driven by the agenda setting of several parties, agenda reinforcement, and increasing political polarization
    - The paper suggests that the conspirative and polarized political scene may jeopardize Slovakia’s position on principal foreign affairs
